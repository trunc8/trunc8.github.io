Welcome! I'm Siddharth Saha.

I earned my Master’s degree in Robotic Systems Development (Class of 2024) from The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University — widely regarded as the mecca of robotics. During my time there, I focused on quadruped robots and completed a 1.5-year-long capstone project under Prof. Sebastian Scherer at AirLab. My work involved using the Unitree quadruped for autonomous search and rescue in unknown, cluttered environments. Broadly, I aim to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured settings, with particular interest in motion planning, legged locomotion, and optimization.

Before CMU, I graduated from IIT Bombay in 2021 with degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. There, I co-founded a fully-funded technical team dedicated to building a quadruped robot, with the ambitious goal of competing in the RoboCup Rescue League — an international challenge for urban search and rescue.

My software engineering journey spans both fast-paced prototyping and large-scale systems. I’ve developed short-life codebases that powered national and international robotics competition wins, and contributed to production-grade systems at Tesla, Amazon Robotics and Goldman Sachs. I’ve also contributed to open-source robotics software through JdeRobot.

Beyond robotics and code, I’m an avid admirer of talent in the arts and music. I find deep inspiration in people whose gifts lie outside my own — and strive to learn from them.
