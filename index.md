Welcome! I am Siddharth Saha. My friends call me *Saha*. 

I am currently living my dream — studying at the mecca of robotics, [The Robotics Institute @ CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), and working on quadrupeds. I am in the [M.S. Robotic Systems Development](https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/) program, Batch of 2024. My program's cornerstone is the 1.5-year-long capstone project, which I was fortunate to have with [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/), [AirLab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/air-lab/). I used the Unitree quadruped robot for search and rescue in unknown and cluttered environments. Through my life’s work, I want to advance robotic capabilities in unstructured environments with three focuses: motion planning, legged locomotion, and optimization.


I graduated from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021, attaining a Bachelor's (with Honors) in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/) and a Minor degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to work under the guidance of wonderful mentors. I worked with [Prof. Leena Vachhani](https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/) on my Undergraduate Thesis and [Prof. Prasanna Gandhi](https://www.me.iitb.ac.in/~gandhi/) on another research project related to modeling ultra-flexible inverted pendulum

At the institute, I was the founding member of a fully-funded technical team building a quadruped robot and motivated to solve the international urban search and rescue challenge [RoboCup Rescue League](https://www.robocup.org/leagues/10)

My interests lie at the intersection of optimization and planning for legged robots.

What distinguishes me, however, is my resilience, curiosity, and hacker mindset.

*Resilience*: Despite my humble family background, I was dead set on a career in robotics during college. I worked for a year after graduation in finance to fund my M.S. tuition. I simultaneously pursued robotics research and completed my Google Summer of Code at JdeRobot.

*Curiosity*: I take delight in questioning what goes behind everyday technologies that we take for granted.

*Hacker mindset*: My dopamine hits arise from hacking around problems. For instance, I use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) over OverLeaf because of its speed. But TeXstudio's symbols packages clashed with the powerline symbols on my [Linux rice](https://trunc8.github.io/2021/03/10/first-linux-rice). I put my TeXstudio inside a Docker environment and faced no problem ever again! I have [blogged](https://trunc8.github.io/2021/05/22/tut-texstudio-docker) about the steps to achieve this.

My software engineering experiences range from short-life codes, which won me national and international robotics competitions, to long-life codes, contributing to the mammoth code base at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) and doing open source at [JdeRobot](https://jderobot.github.io/).

Besides my love for coding and robotics, I enjoy admiring talent across arts and music — to be inspired by people more gifted than me. Watching [Matt McGuire](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYgzfr61oR0a9yskssoERg) at the drums never fails to electrify me, and listening to [Coldplay](https://open.spotify.com/track/23khhseCLQqVMCIT1WMAns?si=ea502276098045d1) fills me with joy.

This website is a quick outlet for my [thoughts and life updates](blog)

### Questions That Inspire Me
- **Multi-modality during Legged locomotion**: 
    + What gait patterns could be more energy efficient than their wheeled counterparts?
    + How does the control generalize over complex foothold constraints, like steep stairs, slippery terrain, sharp rocks, rubble? 
    + Can we design perception/sensing algorithms to infer foothold constraints from the world in real-time? 
    + When a biped has lost balance and is about to fall, can it reflexively extend its arms to brace for impact or reflexively grip a rigid object to prevent the fall?
- **Optimization**
    + How can we combine methods from Trajectory and Gait optimization, Pose Graph optimization, and Policy optimization to answer the above questions?
