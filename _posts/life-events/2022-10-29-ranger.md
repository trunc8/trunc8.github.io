Tried `Midnight Commander`. Didn't like as much. 

`Ranger` stuck!

I had been contemplating and dreaming of using a terminal file manager for the longest time. The time is finally here.

I have already started playing around with its config parameters.

- Enabled image and pdf preview using method `ueberzug`
- I had to install a couple of libraries in order for `ueberzug` to pip install. I hope it doesn't break any other of my dependencies

Really feeling the lack of `fasd` shortcuts here. I will try to integrate them soon.
