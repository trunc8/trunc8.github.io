### Nov 09, '22
- Autorotation
    + Autorotation is the state of flight where the main rotor system is being turned by the force of the relative wind rather than engine power
    + It is the means by which a helicopter can be landed safely in the event of an engine failure
- Gimbal lock
    + Gimbal lock is the loss of one degree of freedom in a three-dimensional, three-gimbal mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, "locking" the system into rotation in a degenerate two-dimensional space
- Python prefix `r` or `R`
    + Python raw string. It treats backlash as literal character (instead of escape character).

- When does MATLAB generate asv file? 
> If you edit an M file in the MATLAB Editor/Debugger and do not save your edits within the span of five minutes, MATLAB creates an autosaved version of your edited file. That version is saved with the . asv file extension."
- Subl Shortcuts: 
    + `Shift + Alt + Minus` = Jump Forward
    + `Alt + Minus` = Jump Back
    + `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+1` = fold all blocks that are indented with a certain level (`1` in this example)
    + `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+0` = unfold everything again
