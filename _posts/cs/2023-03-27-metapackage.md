A metapackage is a package of packages. It does not contain code or physically contain the other packages. It is just a convenience tool. If a group of packages *should* be together, that information can be added inside a metapackage. So you can `apt install` or `catkin build` only the metapackage's name and the coherent group of packages will all be built together.

While populating the `package.xml`, I realized that you should avoid putting only the metapackage name, and put the actual list of packages instead. Else, `catkin build` throws a warning, for example --
> WARNING: package "grid_map_simpletest" should not depend on metapackage "grid_map" but on its packages instead
