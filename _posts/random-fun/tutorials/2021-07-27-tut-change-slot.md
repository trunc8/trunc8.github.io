### Background
I use a rooted Android device to enjoy several upsides in device capabilities. I occasionally run into trouble with OS upgrades though.


#### Procedure for installing upgrades
1. Download and install the System Updates
2. Press "Install" in Magisk
3. Choose "Install to Inactive Slot (After OTA)"
4. "Reboot"


### Problem
Occasionally I perform the Magisk steps too soon after the System Updates only finish downloading and aren't installed completely. The device obliges and boots into the inactive partition slot, and enters a bootloop or asks you to wipe the data. 


### Solution
Connect Android device to Linux system via USB cable and run following commands in the terminal
```sh
sudo apt install android-tools-adb
sudo apt install android-tools-fastboot
fastboot devices
fastboot getvar current-slot
fastboot --set-active=b
# If current-slot is "b", set active slot to be "a"
```
