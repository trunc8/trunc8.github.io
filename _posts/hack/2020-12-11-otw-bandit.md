The [bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is meant for beginners in hacking. Several of these levels required persistence and the ingenuity of the solution was the sweet fruit of the efforts. I had to look up the solution for two of these levels and I still wonder, "Man, how was I supposed to think of that?" XD


I can finally move on to tougher wargames with a lot more confidence in Linux under my belt.
